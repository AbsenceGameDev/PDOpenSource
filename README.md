# Permadev Open Source

This is a project where I will work on open-source plugins (BSL 1.1 License) I am developing for a personal game project.
BSL license TLDR: 
- In 4 year the projects reverts to an 'apache 2.0 license'
- Until then the licence imposes some usage restrictions (Commercial usage allowed under certain, loose, conditions)


## In progress
- MissionCore   (Mission/quest system abstractions)
- MissionEditor (Visual editor for questlines)

## To-do
- Interaction system
- Statistical progression system
